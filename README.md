# nonlinear_svm

In this project I developed a program that generates nonlinearly separable data.  This data is mapped into a higher dimesnion using a kernel trick where the data becomes linearly separable.  This project also showcases how to plot the optimal hyperplane of a 3D svm which can be confusing.
